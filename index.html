        <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>In the past few years I have focused on my passions for writing and producing music, and expressing myself artistically in those ways. Similarly to producing and writing my own music, I had a deep interest for writing and crafting apps and websites using code. </p>
        <p>As a current student at Thinkful, I have set forth a path to advance my knowledge, and expand my repertoire of projects continuously. </p>
        <p>If you are looking for a new motivated developer (or just looking to connect with a fellow programmer) please reach out! I'm very excited to work with other developers to build great software.</p>
